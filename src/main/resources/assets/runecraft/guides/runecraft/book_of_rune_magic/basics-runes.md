# Runes

Runes are at the core of everything here, there's one for every letter, plus a few extra ones! 

*Rune Dust* is required to start, this is made from Ash and *Nether Warts* on the one hand. *Ash* can be found as blocks in the nether in basalt deltas or by killing *Blazes*.

All the *Runes* of the alphabet can now be crafted from the dust.
