# The Altar

The *Altar* is important for gaining access to the more powerful items and spells! 

It can either be crafted or found in rare places in your world.

For rituals, spells and curses at the *Altar* it is mostly required that it's currently night, there is enough *XP* and sometimes the right moon phase prevails.


But be careful! Using the *Altar* can create lightning bolts and dangerous *Vex*!
